    "section": "Methods",
    "text": "Methods\n\nStudy Design and Cohort\nWe conducted a retrospective simulation-based analysis of 494 breast cancer patients. The analytic dataset (see Data Preparation) included demographic, clinical, and biomarker variables aligned for prognostic modeling.\n\n\nData Preparation\nThis analysis utilized a simulated dataset designed to replicate the key features of a real-world study evaluating a Cox-based composite score as an In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) test for predicting 5-year disease-free survival in breast cancer. The simulation was engineered to reflect biological plausibility, pre-analytical variability, analytical measurement noise, and missing data patterns typical of biomarker studies. The primary goal was to create a robust platform for evaluating the diagnostic performance of the composite score (CoxRisk) while controlling the overall 5-year event rate at a target of 40%.\nThe simulation was constructed in the R statistical environment (version 4.3.2) using a multi-step process, as detailed below.\n\nStudy Design and Covariate Generation\nA cohort of n = 494 hypothetical breast cancer patients was generated. This sample size provides sufficient statistical power for subsequent survival and diagnostic accuracy analyses while remaining computationally efficient.\n\nClinical Covariates: A base dataset was created containing patient-level clinical and demographic variables known to influence prognosis.\n\nAge was simulated from a normal distribution (mean = 65, sd = 10) and categorized into groups (&lt;70, ≥70).\nChemotherapy status was assigned (“Yes”/“No”) with a 60% prevalence.\nBMI_cat was generated from categories (“Underweight”, “Normal”, “Overweight”, “Obese”) with prespecified probabilities.\nDiag_year (2005-2021) was simulated and later categorized to reflect potential era-based treatment differences.\n\nIVD Meta-Data: To mirror a multi-site IVD validation study, pre-analytical and analytical batch variables were created for each sample.\n\nSite, Lot, and Operator: Each sample was assigned to one of three Sites, three Lots, and six Operators to introduce batch effects.\nSample Quality Metrics: Realistic pre-analytical variables were included:\n\nMatrix (Serum/Plasma)\nCollection_to_Freeze_hrs\nStorage_days\nFreezeThaw_cycles\nHemolysis_index\nThese variables were later used to model pre-analytical degradation and missingness.\n\n\n\n\n\nBiomarker Simulation: Biology and Measurement\nThree correlated latent biomarkers (A, B, C) were simulated to represent the underlying biology of aggressive disease.\n\nTrue Biological Signals: Latent variables (Z_A, Z_B, Z_C) were drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with a predefined correlation matrix (correlations ~0.3-0.4), reflecting the biological interplay between pathways.\nScaling to Assay Range: The latent variables were transformed via a logit-based scaling function to produce True biomarker concentrations within plausible, assay-specific ranges (A: 0.2-12, B: 0.1-8, C: 0.5-10 units). This preserved the rank order of values while constraining them to a realistic scale.\nIntroduction of Measurement Variability: The measured values were derived from the true values by introducing several sources of variability:\n\nBatch Effects: Systematic shifts (sfx, lfx, ofx) were added based on the sample’s assigned Site, Lot, and Operator.\nPre-Analytical Degradation: A composite total_pre_fx variable was calculated as a linear combination of the sample quality metrics (e.g., hemolysis, storage time), acting as a small multiplicative degradation factor.\nRandom Analytical Noise: Independent, normally distributed random error was added to each marker, with assay-specific variances.\n\nLimit of Detection (LoD) Handling: To mimic real-world assay limitations, values below a predefined assay-specific LoD were imputed using the common approximation LoD / √2.\n\n\n\nSurvival Time Generation with Prevalence Tuning\nA critical aspect of the simulation was to ensure the 5-year event rate converged to a specified target prevalence of 40%, making the dataset suitable for diagnostic accuracy evaluation.\n\nLinear Predictor Construction: A linear predictor for the hazard function (lp_surv) was built by combining the effects of clinical covariates (increased hazard for no chemotherapy and age ≥70) and a placeholder composite score (SimRisk) derived from the three measured markers.\nEvent Time Generation: Survival times were generated from a Weibull distribution (shape ρ=1.5, indicating increasing hazard over time). Censoring times were generated from a uniform distribution (12-120 months) to create a realistic right-censored dataset.\nAuto-Tuning Algorithm: A robust tuning algorithm was implemented to calibrate the baseline hazard scale parameter (lambda):\n\nA target 5-year event prevalence of 40% was set.\nThe baseline hazard was systematically multiplied by a scaling factor (lmult).\nFor each candidate lmult, event times were generated using a fixed set of uniform random variables (U_tune).\nThe algorithm bracketed the target prevalence and used a root-finding method (uniroot) to solve for the optimal lmult that achieved the exact 5-year event rate. This ensured the final dataset’s event rate was precisely controlled at the desired level.\n\nBinary Endpoint Definition: The primary binary endpoint for diagnostic evaluation (y5) was defined as an event (disease recurrence or death) occurring within 60 months (5 years).\n\n\n\nConstruction of the IVD Index Test (CoxRisk)\nThe composite IVD test was derived a posteriori on the full cohort to emulate a locked-down assay algorithm before its diagnostic evaluation.\n\nCox Proportional-Hazards Model: A multivariable Cox model was fitted to the full simulated dataset, regressing survival time and status on the three measured markers (marker_a, marker_b, marker_c) and the clinical covariates (chemotherapy, age_group).\nRisk Score Calculation: The linear predictor (log-hazard) from this fitted model was extracted for each patient to create the continuous CoxRisk score.\nDichotomization: For binary classification, patients were stratified into “High risk” and “Low risk” groups based on whether their CoxRisk score was above or below the median.\n\n\n\nIntroduction of Missing Data\nMissing data were introduced after the CoxRisk score was calculated to ensure the diagnostic subset used for evaluation would retain both event and non-event cases.\n\nMissingness Mechanism: Missing-at-random (MAR) patterns were simulated. The probability of a marker being missing was linked to sample quality variables (Hemolysis_index, Storage_days), making poor-quality samples more likely to have missing biomarker results.\nAssay-Specific Patterns: The overall missingness probability was set highest for Marker C (~35% max), intermediate for Marker B, and lowest for Marker A, reflecting hypothetical differences in assay robustness.\nSafeguard for Diagnostic Subset: A check was performed to ensure that the subset of patients with complete data for both CoxRisk and y5 (the diagnostic subset) maintained a non-extreme prevalence. If this subset became too small or its prevalence approached 0% or 100%, the missingness parameters were automatically relaxed.\n\n\n\nReplicate Measurements for Precision Analysis\nA separate dataset (replicates_long) was generated to assess the analytical precision of the biomarker assays, which is a key component of IVD validation.\n\nDesign: Two replicate measurements per patient were simulated across two separate days.\nVariability Components: Measurements included:\n\nWithin-run noise: Random error added to each replicate.\n\nBetween-day drift: A systematic small shift (drift_day) was added to all measurements on the second day.\nThis dataset allows for the calculation of within-run, between-day, and total precision (coefficient of variation) for each biomarker.\n\n\n\nFinal Datasets for Analysis\nThe simulation produced three primary objects for the subsequent report:\n\nanalysis_ivd: The main patient-level dataset containing survival times, event indicators, the binary endpoint (y5), clinical covariates, measured biomarkers (with missingness), and the derived CoxRisk score and group.\ncox_fit: The fitted Cox model object, used for calculating time-dependent AUC and calibration.\nreplicates_long: The dataset of replicate measurements for precision analysis.\n\nThis comprehensive simulation framework provides a realistic and controlled environment for evaluating the performance of a Cox-based composite score as a putative IVD.\n\n\n\nPrognostic Modeling\nWe fit a Cox proportional hazards model (coxph) with candidate predictors selected from clinical and biomarker variables. Model performance was evaluated at a fixed time horizon of 5 years (60 months). Predicted absolute risk was computed using predictRisk, generating per-patient risk estimates (risk_teval).\n\n\nDiscrimination\nTo quantify discriminative ability, we computed the Harrell’s concordance index (C-index) across the entire follow-up and the time-dependent AUC at 5 years using the inverse probability of censoring weights (IPCW) estimator. Kaplan–Meier curves stratified by quartiles of predicted risk illustrated separation in observed survival.\nBecause the Cox model and its performance were evaluated on the same dataset, reported discrimination metrics reflect apparent (in-sample) performance. This approach is appropriate for a simulated demonstration. In applied settings, estimates would be optimism-adjusted using bootstrap internal validation or derived from a train/test split or cross-validation.\n\n\nCalibration\nCalibration was assessed at 5 years using two complementary approaches.\n\nCalibration coefficients: logistic regressions with offset yielded the calibration intercept (ideal = 0) and slope (ideal = 1).\nCalibration plot: observed event rates were compared against mean predicted risks within deciles, with loess smoothing for visualization.\n\nAs with discrimination, calibration results represent apparent (in-sample) performance because the model was both trained and evaluated on the same dataset. This is suitable for a simulated setting. In applied analyses, calibration would typically be assessed on validation data or after bootstrap adjustment to account for optimism.\n\n\nAccuracy\nThe Brier score was calculated at 5 years as the mean squared difference between observed outcomes and predicted risks, with lower values indicating better probability accuracy.\n\n\nDiagnostic Performance\nAs a sensitivity analysis, predicted risks were dichotomized at the median cutoff. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV), and likelihood ratios. Exact binomial confidence intervals were reported for sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV.\nBecause the risk model and its performance were evaluated on the same dataset, all performance metrics represent apparent (in-sample) performance. This approach is appropriate for a simulated demonstration. In applied settings, however, estimates would be optimism-adjusted using bootstrap internal validation, or derived from a train/test split or cross-validation.\n\n\nPrecision and Reproducibility\nAnalytical precision of biomarker replicates was evaluated using mixed-effects models (lmer) with variance components for within-run and between-day variation. Coefficients of variation (CV%) were summarized by marker. Agreement across repeated measures was visualized with Bland–Altman plots. QC plots stratified by site, lot, and operator displayed reproducibility across operational factors."

This broad perspective provides a nuanced understanding of model performance. Limitations include the simulated nature of the data, which may not fully capture real-world heterogeneity, the assumption of missing-at-random (MAR) mechanisms rather than potentially more complex missing-not-at-random (MNAR) patterns, and the limited spread of predicted risks, which constrained discrimination. Incorporating additional prognostic features or molecular markers may improve model performance in future applications."
